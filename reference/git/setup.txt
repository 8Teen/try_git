SSH setup
---------
The following commands and steps are used to configure two accounts in the same computer to work with Github or
any other git server that accepts SSH.

NOTE: As a reference URL use the following https://gist.github.com/2351996
TO use the following commands use the Git command shell (windows) or a terminal in Linux/Unix/Mac OS X.

1. Create the public/private SSH keys.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@youremail.com"
NOTE: Write down the file where you created the keys into.

2. Add keys to SSH repository.
$ ssh-add id_rsa_carlosorgit --> and any other you SSH key file you need.

3. Check your saved files.
$ ssh-add -l

4. Create a SSH config file to be like the following sample (remember, a sample file is located near this file).
#Default GitHub
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  
#Another user
Host github.com-carlosorgit
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_carlosorgit

5. Now change the remote origin in git config files to point to the required SSH identity file.
Here let's tuppose we want to use the id_rsa_carlosorgit then your config file must be set as 
[remote "origin"]
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	url = git@github.com-carlosorgit:CSoftZ/try_git.git 
as an example, here you copy the SSH url given at the github web site, e.g.,
git@github.com:CSoftZ/try_git.git and change the github.com (default host as named in the SSH config file) to
github.com-carlosorgit and not GIT will now to which credentials it will communicate to server or the other end point.

6. Create batch files or shell command files to put the user.name and user.email for the global environment settings
for git to properly mark your commit accordingly.
Here follows and example.

exec git config --global user.name "Carlos Adolfo Ortiz Quiros"
exec git config --global user.email carlosaortiz@yahoo.com 

and execute accordingly in order for your commits to be fully referenced in the social part at github.com

Lastly there is a configuration file for SSH keys in this folder for you to check out
the process.
